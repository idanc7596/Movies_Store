# Movies Store
a modern e-commerce website that allows customers to browse movies, add them to a cart, and complete a purchase.
Using TMDB (The Movies DB) api to browse the movies.
Client side is written in React, while server side is written with Spring.

## Demonstration

## Explanations
<p>
The regular search (according to string) is in the "Search" page, <br>
<b>while the search according to the other two attributes (genres and release year) <br>
is in a separate page called "Discover".</b>
</p>

<div>
The search in the Discover page is done according to the following two attributes:
<ul>
<li>genres</li>
<li>release year</li>
</ul>
(you can search by one of them or both combined).
</div>

## Running the project
In order to run the project make sure to:
1. Run the SQL server and create a database named "ex4". 
2. Initializing the React client (movie-app) - Open a terminal in *movie-app* and run `npm install` and then `npm start`. You should see the client running on http://localhost:3000.
