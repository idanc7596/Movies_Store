## Explanations
<p>
The regular search (according to string) is in the "Search" page, <br>
while the search according to the other two attributes (genres and release year) <br>
is in a separate page called "Discover".

## Running the project
In order to run the project make sure to:
1. Run the SQL server and create a database named "ex4". 
2. Initializing the React client (movie-app) - Open a terminal in *movie-app* and run `npm install` and then `npm start`. You should see the client running on http://localhost:3000.
